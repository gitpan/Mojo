- Test::Mojo::* needs a better API.

- Chunked transfer encoding could use better abstraction, it's currently
  split between Curse::Message and Curse::Content.
  
- The ability to add more content handlers besides Curse::Content and
  Curse::Content::MultiPart might be interesting.

- A lot of code needs to be cleaned, especially around Curse::Message.

- Tons of RFC spec tests need to be written.

- Documentation.
