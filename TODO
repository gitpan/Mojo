*** IMPORTANT

- All done for now.

*** IDEAS

- The ability to add more content handlers and filters besides
  Mojo::Content::Multipart and Mojo::Filter::Chunked might be interesting.
  (Would be a good sponsored project i guess)

*** THE USUAL STUFF THAT WILL BE ON THIS LIST FOREVER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE
    ENOUGH OF IT :)

- A lot of code needs to be cleaned.

- Tons of RFC spec tests need to be written.

- Documentation.
