        - Added the Mojolicious Web Framework example.
        - Hooks for upload progress and stuff added.
        - Refactored transfer encoding code into Mojo::Filter and
          Mojo::Filter::Chunked.
        - Added callbacks for start line and header generators.
        - Added workaround for missing IO::Seekable support in older
          versions of File::Temp (Perl 5.8).
        - script/mojo.pl got renamed to script/mojo, this will make it easier
          to differentiate between the global mojo and the local mojo.pl.
        - Mojo::Cache got renamed to Mojo::File because there will be a cache
          module named MojoX::Cache, and that could cause confusion later on.
        - Fixed many escaping related bugs around Mojo::URL.
        - Fixed 100-Continue support in Mojo::Server::Daemon and Mojo::Client.
        - Countless small bugs fixed and tests added.
